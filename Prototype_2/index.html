        <p>Subways are everywhere in the city. They help us navigate easily and on time throughout the day as they are not affected by traffic. However, dates & locations can affect and modify the way we take the subway. More to that, the subway helps us from saving the planet as it can avoid a certain amount of carbon emission by 'not taking the car'. Saving Carbon emissions + Traffic is another data that we will be illustrating throughout this project. 

            Another element we will be addressing is the carbon emission of cars/traffic. How much carbon emission are we saving by taking the subway? These two factors are in a way correlated as our analysis on subways may also illustrate aspects about the environment (meaning that we will analyze how much carbon 1 subway ride v/s 1 car ride can produce). 
            
            Some of the different variations we will be observing will be related to past events that will have a major impact on those services.  Why do the numbers vary? what caused this variation? What are the major factors? Is it in the long or short term?</p>
